        <h2 >Definition</h2>
        <p >Quantum Computing (QC) is a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform operations on data. QC uses qubits instead of classical bits, which allows for much faster and more efficient computation.  </p>
      </section>
      <section id="principle">
        <h2 >Principle</h2>
        <p >The principle behind QC is that qubits can exist in multiple states at the same time, known as superposition,  and they can become correlated with one another, known as entanglement. These properties allow quantum computers to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="architecture">
        <h2 >Architecture</h2>
        <p >There are several different architectures for building a quantum computer, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and topological qubits. Each architecture has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of architecture will depend on the specific application of the quantum computer.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="applications">
        <h2 >Applications</h2>
        <p >QC has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries, including finance, healthcare, and transportation. In finance, QC can be used for portfolio optimization, risk management, and fraud detection. In healthcare, QC can be used for drug discovery, medical imaging analysis, and personalized medicine. In transportation, QC can be used for traffic management systems and self-driving cars.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="future">
        <h2 >Future of QC</h2>
        <p >The future of QC is expected to involve the development of even more powerful and scalable quantum computers, as well as the integration of QC with other technologies such as AI, the Internet of Things, and blockchain. As QC technology continues to evolve, it will play an increasingly important role in a wide range of industries, improving efficiency and decision-making.</p>
