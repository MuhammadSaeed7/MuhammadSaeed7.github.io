        <h2 >Definition</h2>
        <p >Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. It involves the development of algorithms and computer programs that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.</p>

      <section id="history">
        <h2 >History</h2>
        <p >The concept of AI has been around for decades, but it has recently gained more attention due to advancements in technology such as increased computing power and access to large amounts of data. Over the years, AI has evolved from simple rule-based systems to more advanced systems that can learn and improve over time.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="types">
        <h2 >Types of AI</h2>
        <p >There are several types of AI including: Reactive Machines, Limited Memory, Theory of Mind, Self-Aware. Each type of AI has its own capabilities and limitations. Reactive Machines, for example, can only respond to the current situation and cannot use past experiences to inform future decisions, while Limited Memory AI can use past experiences to inform future decisions, but it cannot form long-term memories.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="applications">
        <h2 >Applications</h2>
        <p >AI has a wide range of applications, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. In healthcare, AI can be used for medical imaging analysis, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. In finance, AI can be used for fraud detection, risk management, and portfolio optimization. In transportation, AI can be used for self-driving cars and traffic management systems.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="future">
        <h2 >Future of AI</h2>
        <p >As AI technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more intelligent and capable machines. The future of AI is likely to involve the integration of AI with other technologies such as the Internet of Things, blockchain, and quantum computing. AI will also continue to play an increasingly important role in a wide range of industries, improving efficiency and decision-making.</p>
