       <p>There are several technologies that are currently being developed or are expected to be developed in the near future that will have a significant impact on the way we drive.</p> 
       <section id="Auto vehicles">
        <h2>Autonomus Vehicles <span><center><img src="auto vehicles.jpg" height="300" width="500"></center></span></h2>
        <p>Self-driving cars are vehicles that are capable of sensing their environment and navigating without human input. They use a combination of sensors such as cameras, LIDAR, radar, and ultrasonic sensors, as well as advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence, to make decisions and control the vehicle. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to greatly improve safety on the roads and reduce the number of accidents caused by human error.</p>
       </section>
       <section id="connected cars">
        <h2>Connected Cars <span><center><img src="connected car.jpg" height="300" width="500"></center></span></h2>
        <p>Connected cars are vehicles that are able to communicate with other cars and with infrastructure such as traffic lights and road signs. This allows for real-time traffic updates, and enables cars to optimize their routes and reduce congestion.</p>
       </section>
       <!-- <section id="EV">
        <h2>Electric Vehicles <span><center><img src="ev.jpg" height="300" width="500"></center></span></h2>
        <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are powered by batteries and do not rely on fossil fuels. They produce zero emissions and can help to reduce air pollution and dependence on oil.</p>
       </section> -->
       <section id="car-sharing...">
        <h2>Car-Sharing & Ride-Hailing Services</h2>
        <p>Car-sharing and ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft are becoming increasingly popular, and are expected to continue to grow in the future. They allow individuals to easily rent or hail a ride on demand, and can reduce the need for personal car ownership.</p>
       </section>
       <section id="smart city">
        <h2>Smart Cities <span><center><img src="smart city.jpg" height="300"  width="500"></center></span></h2>
        <p>Smart cities: Smart cities are cities that use technology to improve the quality of life for citizens. Smart transportation systems can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve air quality.</p>
       </section>
       <p>These technologies have the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and safety of transportation, while also reducing pollution and congestion. However, they also raise important questions about data privacy, cybersecurity, and the potential impact on employment and the economy.</p>
