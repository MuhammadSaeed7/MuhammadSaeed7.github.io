        <h2>Definition </h2> 
        <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional environment that can be interacted with using specialized hardware, such as a VR headset. The technology immerses the user in a digital world, providing a sense of presence in the environment.</p>

      <section id="history">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The concept of virtual reality has been around for several decades, but it wasn't until the 1990s that the technology became more accessible to consumers with the introduction of affordable VR headsets. In recent years, advancements in technology have made VR even more accessible and the number of VR applications has grown.</p>

      <section id="hardware">
        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <p>VR technology requires specialized hardware, such as a VR headset, to fully immerse the user in the virtual environment. These headsets typically include a display screen, sensors for tracking head movement, and built-in headphones for audio. Some VR systems also include hand-held controllers for interacting with the virtual environment.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="applications">
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>VR has many potential applications, including gaming, education, and training. VR can be used to create realistic simulations for training purposes, such as for pilots or surgeons. It can also be used to create virtual tours of historical sites, museums, or famous monuments. Additionally, VR has therapeutic potential for mental health treatment, it can be used to treat phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by exposing patients to simulated versions of the things they fear in a controlled environment.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="future">
        <h2>Future of VR</h2>
        <p>As technology continues to advance, the possibilities for VR are endless. In the future, we can expect to see even more realistic and immersive virtual environments, as well as the integration of VR with other technologies such as augmented reality and the Internet of Things. VR will change the way we interact with digital environments and revolutionize many industries.</p>
