        <h2 >5G</h2>
        <p >5G is the fifth generation of mobile networks and it is designed to provide faster data speeds, lower latency and more reliable connections. 5G networks can offer peak data rates of up to 20 Gbps and can support up to 1 million devices per square kilometer. 5G networks also use advanced technologies such as millimeter-wave frequency bands and beamforming to improve coverage and capacity.</p>

        <h2 >6G</h2>
        <p >6G is the sixth generation of mobile networks and it is currently in the research and development phase. It aims to provide even faster data speeds and lower latency than 5G. Some of the key features of 6G include Terahertz frequency bands, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning based network optimization and security enhancement. 6G is expected to offer data speeds of up to 1 Tbps and support for up to 1 billion devices per square kilometer. </p>

        <p > <big>Use of different spectrum: </big><br>
            

            <p >5G and 6G use wireless spectrum of higher range for data transmission faster than 4G, 3G, and 2G networks. However, when comparing 5G vs 6G, the former one is allocated for low band and high band frequencies – sub-6 GHz (Gigahertz) and above 24.25 GHz respectively. The latter one will be operative at the frequency range 95 GHz to 3 THz (Terahertz). Since, different spectrum is used, 5G vs 6G technology can have multiple use cases for a variety of industrial sectors to enhance their efficiency.</p>

            <p >
            Taking into the performance factor, 6G will contribute to higher performance which is far better than newly deployed 5G wireless networks. Operating at terahertz frequency bands, 6G will deliver a peak data rate of 1,000 gigabits/s having air latency less than 100 microseconds. When we talk about 5G vs 6G network speed, 6G speed is expected to be 100 times faster than 5G with enhanced reliability and wider network coverage.

            <p >
            Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a reality today with the implementation of 5G based solutions following extensive 5G network testing which was not possible with previous networks like 4G LTE due to poor planning of frequencies applied. Frequencies used were too narrow and crowded for transmitting data required by smart devices to give desired results. This is where 5G filled in the gap and moving ahead with 6G we expect to connect ten times more devices per square kilometer with increase in number of connected devices in the upcoming years.

            <br>
            <br>
            The time taken by a packet of information transmitted over a frequency is known as latency. 4G networks had a latency of about 50 milliseconds (ms) whereas 5G networks had ten times lower latency than 4G i.e., 5ms. With 6G internet, latency will slip down to range 1millisecond to 1microsecond, lowering latency to five times than that of fifth-generation network making massive data transmissions possible in less than a second.
